Introduction

Problems in Current Systems
Centralized Profit Models:
Social media giants profit from user-generated content, selling advertisements while providing little to no financial benefit to the creators or users.

Data Exploitation:

User data is monetized without consent, eroding privacy and trust.

Inequitable Financial Systems:

Economic systems often exclude large populations due to barriers like banking access, fees, or geographic limitations.

Underappreciation of Time and Effort:

The time users spend engaging on platforms is undervalued and unacknowledged.
